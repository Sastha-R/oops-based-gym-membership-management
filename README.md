- Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
- Internet access for CDN-hosted libraries


## How to Run the Project

### 1. Start the backend

Run this command from the project root:

```bash
npx json-server data/db.json --port 3000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the frontend

- Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.


## Usage Instructions

### Customer Registration

1. Open the landing page.
2. Select **Register**.
3. Enter a name, email address, 10-digit phone number, and password.
4. Submit the form.
5. Log in using the newly registered credentials.

Newly registered users are assigned the `customer` role.

3. Select **Buy** to purchase a plan.
4. When the membership expires, select **Renew**.

4. Edit, delete, or restore plans using the available actions.
5. Review member information and membership status in the members section.


## Configuration

The API base URL is configured in `script/common.js`:

```javascript
const API_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
```

JSON Server must use port `3000` unless the source configuration is changed.

The theme and logged-in user are stored in browser local storage under `theme` and `loggedInUser`. No environment variables or separate configuration files are present.

## API and Backend Information

The project uses JSON Server with `data/db.json`.

### Resources

 Resource,Endpoint and Description 

 Users -> `/users`  Owner and customer accounts 
 Plans -> `/plans`  Membership plans 
 Memberships -> `/memberships`  Customer membership records 

### Data Relationships

- A membership references a user through `userId`.
- A membership references a plan through `planId`.
- Membership status is calculated from `expiryDate`.
- Plans use `isDeleted` for soft deletion.

## Default Login Credentials

The database includes the following owner account:

 Role:Owner 
 Email:`admin@gmail.com`
 Password: `123456789@aA`

Additional customer accounts are present in `data/db.json`.
